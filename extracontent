Many advancements have been made in recent years: social media, e-commerce, VOIP, video streaming. Every single one of these innovations, that have changed the way we interact with the world and with each other in their own right, rely on the work done by Berners-Lee at CERN. Whilst the interactivity of the modern web was but a glimmer in his eye back in the 90s, the foundations set the stage for what was to come. Even in its nascent stages, the web had a transformative impact, particularly for businesses and academics. 

Even now, the scope of the web is ever growing. Countries like China and India are increasingly coming online, particularly in the middle-class urban communities. As millions of people experience the web for the first time, they become as equally connected to the rest of the world as they are to their closest neighbour. Imagine getting online to find almost any product imagineable just a few mouse clicks away, distant friends and family available more readily than ever before, and a wealth of information just a search away. Your world would be irreversibly changed. That is the change the web has brought about in the past 26 years.

A group I'd like to focus on in particular is the elderly. Whilst they are typically late adopters of new technologies, the web has begun to permeate their lives, in many cases for the better. Thanks to the web, grandparents can follow the lives of their family with ease through the lens of social media. Speaking anecdotally, this is a huge help for grandparents who struggle to get out of the house and therefore struggle to see relatives. In some cases, it also allows them to reconnect with old colleagues that they may never have spoken to again otherwise. Video calling and VOIP are yet more technologies reliant on the web that help connect grandparents to their distant families. No longer must the elderly become isolated in their twilight years, thanks to the advancements of the web.
