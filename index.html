<ul>
    <li>The World Wide Web was created in 1989, with the first web browser being developed in 1990.</li>
    <li>CERN would make the Web free to use for all in 1993, a decision that led to its rapid adoption.</li>
    <li>Despite having only been available to the public for 26 years, the Web has transformed society and is the defining technology of the 21st Century.</li>
    <li>The Web is designed such that a tired CS student in an 11am practical can develop a vaguely functional website.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Imagine a world in which the World Wide Web didn't exist. Google, Facebook, Amazon and all of those services we take for granted today are just glimmers in some programmer's eye. That was the reality just 25 years ago. Not since the Industrial Revolution has there been such a transformation in the lifestyles of people all over the globe. The Web, and all the advacements it has brought, makes our lives almost unrecognisable to people living just a few decades ago.</p>

    <div class="column">
        <p>In today's world, information is readily available on a scale never seen before in human history. With a device that sits in the palm of our hand, we have quicker access to information than a scholar standing in the middle of the Library of Alexandria. With these same devices (and the advancements of the Web), it's possible to speak, face-to-face, with people all over the globe in an instant. Decades ago, this would have been expensive - out of reach for most people. Centuries ago, it was a feat that some of the greatest empires of Europe struggled with. Now anyone with an internet connection and a phone can communicate across the oceans.</p>
